## Wahoo!

Finally, I've decided to do *Something* with this darned github.io instance.

I'm using Hugo, since I honestly don't need anything other than markdown and static site stuff anyway.
Hopefully this'll become a useful resource for myself and others as time goes on. I need a place to document cool stuff I do, and how I approach certain problems I never find the answer to online :^)
