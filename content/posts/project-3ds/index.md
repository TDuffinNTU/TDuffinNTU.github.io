# About *Project Retrospectives*
Welcome to my first, of hopefully many, project retrospectives. I plan to go over all of my favourite projects from university and talk about the work I did for them in a little more detail than I did when I mass-uploaded my projects to github sometime in 2021!

# The Project
Coming toward the end of 2019, I had already spent a few months working with Autodesk 3DS Max as part of my 3D Modeling module. 

With univesity being an absolute slog on my mental health at this point, I was struggling to keep up appearances in seminars. As such, when it came to this project, I had to keep things as simple as I could whilst I crammed everything else in last minute.
