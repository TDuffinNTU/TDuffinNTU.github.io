            This is my little website for showcasing things I'm working on, to yap 
            incessantly about things I care about, or just to document stuff that might be useful to myself later.

            # About me

            Since finishing my BSc Computer Science and Games Technology at NTU, I've worked across the ASP and .NET stack, 
            whilst more recently narrowing my focus in on Frontend Development with Flutter 🐦
            You might even catch me doing a little bit of gamedev with Godot in my spare time too! :D
